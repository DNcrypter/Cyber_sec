socket --> it end point in network
	   --> it is concept of OS. That kernel creates socket from both side 
	       (client and server ).

main objective --> to make basic level of replica of netcat (similar to  
                   meterpreter or netcat shell).

server listening
client send connection req
server accept
client connected
server send hello
client reveive hello

now taking cmd from user without exiting after one cmd
so we write in "while True" loop.
server send cmd as to take input from client.
client use "while true" loop to listen without exiting
client execute cmd.

why we use subprocess in place of os.system? 
=>in os.system, if you execute the cmd then surely it's output will we shown on system. also you can't store it's output in varible.

client send "output"
server receive "output"

scenario1:->
			if we ctrl+c  and start again then show "oserror:Address already in use".
				kernel put socket in time mode that you can't use for given time. 

solution -- we use method that is mention below

scenario2:->
    		server not listen but client send connection
    		show - ConnectionRefusedError:connection refused

solution -- we try until we connect.using "while true" loop
             try->break if we connect and except->pass when show error as  
             ConnectionReFusedError. 


to exit from both side-->  we use if condition







method we used here-->
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)   # IPV4, TCP
s.socket(socket.AF_INET6,socket.SOCK_DGRAM)   # IPV6, UDP
 s.bind(()) # it takes tuple as input
 s.listen() # it takes input as no. of clients
 s.connect(())# it takes tuple
 client,addr = s.accept() #s.accept writes send or receive in client
 						  #and ip and port in addr.
 client.send("")
 s.recv() # it takes input as no. of bytes to receive

 output= subprocess.getoutput(cmd) # it takes input-->cmd , execute it and store it in
       output varible.

 s.setsockopt(level,optname,value) 
 s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET,socket.SO_REUSEADDR,1)  #REUSE parameter allows to 
                                                          use socket again
