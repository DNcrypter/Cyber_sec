 threading --> use to run multi task at a one time.
               (ex: multiple "while true" loops)

 main objective--> to make chating application

 python works on line by line execution. so we use
  threading.

  it takes user defined fuctions and execute them
   parallely

lets make chat bot-->
 server.py, client.py

 
making connection
defining sent_msg and recv_msg fuctions
writing fuction in Thread()
note:- we have to make fuction busy to run Thread() continuously .
       otherwise it will exit. so we run recv_msg() fuction to busy it.

 methods-->
 t1= threading.Thread(target=Name_of_fuction)
 t1.start()
